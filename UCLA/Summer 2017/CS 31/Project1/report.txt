Project 1 Report

5.	inputs:	5.1, apple, -5
	The program outputed "0", "nan" and negative percentages.

6.	I replaced:
		double pctFake = 100.0 * fakePosts / postsReviewed;
		double pctReal = 100.0 * realPosts / postsReviewed;
	with:
		double pctFake = fakePosts / postsReviewed * 100.0;
		double pctReal = realPosts / postsReviewed * 100.0;
	
	Since "fakePosts", "realPosts", and "postsReviewed" are all integers,
	we have integer division FIRST before multiplying by 100.0.
	Since (with expected inputs) "postsReviewed" is greater than "fakePosts" and "realPosts",
	the integer division will result in 0, and "pctFake" and "pctReal" will always be 0.0.

7.	I removed some semicolons 
	and "using namespace std;"
	The compiler needs both of these to compile properly.
